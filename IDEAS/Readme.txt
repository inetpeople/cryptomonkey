Trailing Stop Limit

A trailing stop works like this. 
Suppose I have a stock trading at $100. If I set a 25% trailing stop, my trailing stop will be 25% less of $100, or $75. If the stock falls to $75 at any time, I sell.

Simple enough. But there’s more. 
Let’s say that my stock has risen to $200. 
The protective trailing stop trails along with it. 
So as the stock hits $125, $150, 
and $175, the trailing stop raises. 
$93.75, $112.50, $131.25. 
With the stock at $200, the trailing stop is $150.
